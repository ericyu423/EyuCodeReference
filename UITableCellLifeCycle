     override func layoutSubviews()
     {
         super.layoutSubviews()
         
         //this function is call when 
         //1. cell is loaded the first time
         //2. layout changed .ex    myImage.hidden = true <--- false -> true will cause the layoutsubviews to be call again
         //3. table scrolls in and out of the table (reload)

     }

    {
        super.draw(rect)
        
        //this function is called when

    example.
    
    isCaret check of label is trucated, when the cell is loaded , the bound isze isn't size to 
    what the cell is define.
    
    after downcaret is hidden is called, layoutsubview is called again()
    
    the time the label frame have been properly adjusted to the intended size, now truncation check will work
    
    
    override func layoutSubviews()
    {
        super.layoutSubviews()
      
        if isCaretNeedsToBeHidden()
        {
            downCaretImageView.isHidden = true
        }
        else
        {
            downCaretImageView.isHidden = false
        }
    }
